From building Flash games and Dreamweaver sites as a child to selling custom MySpace pages, designing graphics and producing music throughout my teenage years, I started my first company at 18 after pitching for seed investment through a startup youth project. No degree, no bootcamp. Just 13+ years of building things, breaking things, and figuring it out since.

Over the years I've done everything from design, development and architecture to networking, security and DevOps across several industries including fintech, gaming, sports, media, streaming, e-commerce, enterprise and Web3. Improving processes has always been a passion of mine; whether it's implementing CI/CD pipelines, JIRA workflows, rebuilding legacy .NET products into modern SaaS platforms, or mentoring and running developer workshops on React, testing, design patterns and software architecture. Championing delivery, testing and output quality everywhere I've worked.

After a career break, I've been doing some consultancy work on the side to keep food in the fridge and my servers running while developing my own ideas. My desire to keep improving things, now focused on agentic engineering, has led me to what I'm building now.

<summary><b>What I'm building</b></summary>
<br>

**HibanaJS**: A lightweight, open source, NestJS-inspired backend framework for [Bun](https://bun.sh) + [Hono](https://hono.dev). Familiar decorator-based DX without the overhead. Lightweight by design, blazing fast, runs anywhere Bun does. Currently in final stages; testing, benchmarks and documentation before launch.

**Kodawari.sh**: A development framework for agentic engineering. Quality gates, structured workflows, guardrails and test traceability for AI-assisted development. Building towards both open-source tooling and a commercial platform. (Watch this space!)

**My Flagship SaaS**: A platform I've been planning in my head for years but never had the time for. Now in active development and working towards a beta release.

<summary><b>Tech I reach for</b></summary>
<br>

**Day to day:** Bash, TypeScript, React, Svelte, Node, Bun, Hono, NestJS, data structures, storage and querying of all kinds and any framework that allows me to build performant and SEO friendly sites without having to reach for Next.js if I can avoid it.

**Infrastructure:** AWS, Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Edge Computing, Queue Architectures. A bunch of Raspberry Pis, old repurposed routers, laptops and hard drives hacked together to bring my data offline, work on projects locally and not rely on commercial software. Security-conscious by nature.

**Other tech:** C# .NET, Python, Solidity, GraphQL, Design tools, music production software.
Currently learning Rust.

<summary><b>A bit about me</b></summary>
<br>

Outside of code, I'm into music (it's in the blood; family of musicians), cooking, cycling, and staying ahead of the curve on AI research; exploring its evolving nature, the effects it has on society, our industries, and the deeper questions around feelings, comprehension and sentience.
